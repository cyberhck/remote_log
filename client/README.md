##### Based on [Vortigern](https://github.com/barbar/vortigern)

[![TypeScript](https://barbaruploads.s3.amazonaws.com/bicoz/typescript.png)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
[![React](https://barbaruploads.s3.amazonaws.com/bicoz/react.png)](https://github.com/facebook/react)
[![Redux](https://barbaruploads.s3.amazonaws.com/bicoz/redux.png)](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

## Libraries
This boilerplate uses the following libraries and tools:

#### Core
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) & [React DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react) for views.
- [Router5](https://github.com/router5) to handle in-app routing.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for managing application state.
- [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) to use React-Redux bindings.
- [React-Router5](https://github.com/router5) & [Redux-Router5](https://github.com/router5) integrate router5 with react and redux

#### Utilities
- [Isomorphic Fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) with [ES6-Promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) for using fetch api on both client & server side.
- [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) make side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications easier and better.
- [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
- [RavenJS](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js) for capturing exceptions during run time
- [Raven-for-Redux](https://github.com/captbaritone/raven-for-redux) for error using sentry (use `config/main.local.js` to enable sentry)

#### Build System
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for bundling.
  - [Awesome TypeScript Loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader) as ts loader.
  - [Babel Loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) as js loader.
  - [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) for providing hot reload capability to our development server
  - [TypeStyle](https://github.com/typestyle/typestyle)
  - [File Loader](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader)
  - [URL Loader](https://github.com/webpack/url-loader)
  - [Sourcemap Loader](https://github.com/webpack/source-map-loader)
  - [Manifest Plugin](https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin)
  - [tslint Loader](https://github.com/wbuchwalter/tslint-loader) for using tslint as preloader on build process.

#### Dev & Prod Server
- [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
  - [Webpack Dev Middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware)
  - [Webpack Hot Middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-hot-middleware)
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) for running server both on client and server side.
- [Serve Favicon](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-favicon) for serving favicon.

#### Developer Experience
- [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) for linting TypeScript files.
- [Redux Logger](https://github.com/theaqua/redux-logger)
- [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
- [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) for colored terminal logs.

#### Testing
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) as test runner.
- [TS Jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) as Jest preprocessor
- [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for rendering React Components.
- [Jest Enzyme](https://github.com/blainekasten/enzyme-matchers) for asserting React Components.

## Installation

You can clone from this repository and use master

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/crazyfactory/ts-react-boilerplate
$ cd ts-react-boilerplate
$ npm install
```

## Usage

All commands defaults to development environment. You can set `NODE_ENV` to `production` or use the shortcuts below.

```bash
# Running

$ npm start # This starts the app in development mode

# Starting it with the production build
$ NODE_ENV=production npm start # or
$ npm run start:prod

# Building 

$ npm build # This builds the app in development mode

# Commands below builds the production build
$ NODE_ENV=production npm build # or
$ npm run build:prod

# Testing
$ npm test
```

For Windows users, we recommend using the shortcuts instead of setting environment variables because they work a little different on Windows.

#### Raven
Create main.local.js in config folder and export an object that has `sentry` key like so:
```
module.exports = {
  sentry: {
    dsn: YOUR_DSN,
    release: YOUR_RELEASE_VERSION
  }
  
  // other configs
  ...
}
```
